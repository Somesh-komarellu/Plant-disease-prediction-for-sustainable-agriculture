# Plant-disease-prediction-for-sustainable-agriculture
Overview:

plant health is crucial for sustainable agriculture and food security. Manual identification of plant diseases is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project uses a machine learning model to identify plant diseases from images, providing a fast, accurate, and scalable solution for farmers and agricultural professionals.

Key Features
 AI-Powered Disease Recognition:
Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, our system detects plant diseases early by analyzing images and recognizing symptoms.

Mobile and Web Compatibility:
The system works on both mobile and web platforms, ensuring accessibility for farmers in the field or at home.

 Sustainable Agricultural Practices:
By identifying diseases early, the system helps reduce the use of pesticides and encourages eco-friendly farming methods.

Future Enhancements:

Multilingual Support: For a wider global reach.
Real-Time Monitoring: With IoT sensors to provide environmental data (temperature, humidity, soil moisture).
Pest and Nutrient Detection: Expanding the system to identify pests and nutrient deficiencies.

Technologies Used
The project uses the following powerful frameworks and libraries:

TensorFlow (tf): For building and training machine learning models that recognize plant diseases from images.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data and results, creating plots to present diagnostic information clearly.
Pandas: For handling and processing datasets (e.g., images and labels) in a structured way.
Streamlit (st): For creating an interactive and user-friendly web interface for disease detection.
NumPy: For numerical computations and data manipulation to support the machine learning pipeline.

Usage
Upload an Image:
Take a clear image of the plant leaf showing the disease symptoms and upload it.

AI Analysis:
The system uses TensorFlow to analyze the image and classify the disease.

Receive Recommendations:
The system will display the disease diagnosis and provide recommendations for treatment.
